# EVQ Technical Prototype Report

## 1. Project Overview

EVQ is a front-end prototype for an electric vehicle charging experience designed to help drivers discover, compare, schedule, and track charging stations in a simple and user-friendly way. The project presents itself as a smart charging companion that combines map-based discovery, charging station information, reservation flow, and personal usage history.

The current implementation is a lightweight web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with map visualization powered by Leaflet and OpenStreetMap. It is not yet a full production backend system, but it is a convincing interactive prototype that demonstrates the core user journey of EV charging management.

## 2. Product Intent and Business Logic

The app addresses a real user problem:

- EV drivers need quick access to nearby charging stations.
- They need to know if a station is available, how fast it charges, which plug type it supports, and whether it is renewable or conventional.
- They need an easy way to plan charging sessions and avoid wasting time.
- They also want to track consumption, cost, and environmental impact over time.

EVQ translates this into a digital experience that supports the following goals:

1. Discover charging infrastructure near the user.
2. Reduce uncertainty before travel or arrival.
3. Improve charging efficiency with filtering and recommended stations.
4. Support scheduling and session planning.
5. Give users insight into charging behavior and sustainability metrics.

## 3. Functional Scope of the Prototype

### 3.1 Landing / Home Page
The home page acts as a product showcase and onboarding experience. It presents the brand, value proposition, and key capabilities of the system:

- real-time station mapping
- smart charging recommendations
- reservation flow
- carbon tracking

This page uses a modern visual style with floating background shapes, call-to-action buttons, and feature cards. It creates an early product impression and frames EVQ as a premium mobility assistant.

### 3.2 Find Stations Page
This is the main functional core of the prototype.

Features included:

- location-aware map initialization
- geolocation support using the browser
- station markers on a map
- station status coloring by availability
- list and map view toggling
- filtering by speed, plug type, and renewable energy preference
- station detail panel with:
  - address
  - distance from user
  - connector types
  - charging speed
  - energy source
  - price
  - amenities
  - rating and review count

This page demonstrates the app's core technical behavior: users can identify the most useful charging point in seconds.

### 3.3 Scheduling Page
The scheduling page simulates a future charging reservation flow.

It includes:

- map display of charging options
- station selector UI
- date and time selection
- charging preference filtering
- booking form concept for scheduling charging sessions

This turns the app from a station finder into a planning tool. It allows users to reserve a charging slot before arriving, which is valuable for reducing waiting time and improving user confidence.

### 3.4 History Page
The history page gives the user a retrospective view of energy usage.

It includes:

- charging session list
- date and location filters
- energy source filters
- plug type filters
- summary statistics such as:
  - total sessions
  - total energy used
  - total cost
  - green energy percentage
  - average duration

This part of the app demonstrates the value proposition after charging: users can track personal mobility habits and optimize long-term charging behavior.

### 3.5 Settings Page
The settings page is currently a placeholder but signals a future personalization layer.

Expected future functionalities include:

- preferred charging speed
- renewable energy preference
- home/work charging locations
- notification settings
- payment preferences
- vehicle profile integration

## 4. Technical Architecture

### 4.1 Front-End Architecture
The application is built as a static multi-page web app using:

- HTML for page structure
- CSS for styling and layout
- JavaScript for logic and interactivity

This is a simple but effective architecture for a prototype because it allows rapid UI validation and easy iteration without needing a backend server.

### 4.2 Mapping Stack
The app uses:

- Leaflet.js for interactive maps
- OpenStreetMap tiles for base map visualization

This gives the prototype a realistic experience layer for location discovery. The map is used for:

- centering on the user's location
- placing station markers
- indicating station states
- displaying station details

### 4.3 Mock Data Model
The app uses mock EV station data stored directly in JavaScript. A representative station object includes fields such as:

- id
- name
- address
- latitude and longitude
- status (available, limited, occupied)
- charging speed
- connector types
- price per kWh
- renewable status
- rating
- review count
- amenities

This is sufficient for prototyping because it allows the front-end to simulate real behaviors without connecting to a live API.

### 4.4 User Interaction Model
The prototype uses browser events and dynamic DOM updates to create an interactive flow. Examples include:

- geolocation request on page load
- list and map toggle interaction
- station card selection
- filtering and re-rendering
- selection of a station to populate the detail panel

This demonstrates a realistic interactive system in a simple client-side environment.

## 5. Code Structure Analysis

The project is organized into a small set of pages and scripts:

- index.html — landing page
- find-stations.html — main station discovery screen
- schedule.html — charging reservation planning page
- history.html — charging usage analytics page
- settings.html — personalization screen placeholder
- styles/style.css — unified visual design
- scripts/main.js — base map initialization and desktop sample station rendering
- scripts/find-stations.js — advanced station discovery logic, filters, list/map interaction

### Technical Interpretation

This structure is intentionally modular and easy to extend:

- The HTML pages represent product screens.
- The JavaScript files encapsulate business logic for each user flow.
- The CSS file centralizes the design system, spacing, cards, and component styling.

From an engineering perspective, this is a prototype-friendly layout that supports fast iteration before backend integration.

## 6. User Experience Value Delivered by the Prototype

The real value of EVQ after prototyping is not only the map itself but the reduction of uncertainty in EV charging.

### 6.1 Practical User Benefits
The prototype provides users with:

- fast access to nearby charging stations
- availability awareness before arrival
- station comparison based on speed and plug compatibility
- cost transparency
- renewable energy visibility
